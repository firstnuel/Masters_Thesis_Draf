\section*{Foreword}\label{chapter:foreward}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Foreword}

The foreword is not instructed by the supervisors. In other words, the student may write in this section what she or he wants to share with readers. However, it is a custom to thank all those who have contributed to the research somehow. When acknowledging people, their affiliations are given (e.g. Professor, University Lecturer, Adjunct Professor, Mrs.) 
This guideline is based on the previous version that was written in Finnish and finalised by Dr. Lasse Harjumaa in January 2007. This version is to replace the earlier version. I want to thank all those people who have contributed to the earlier versions and this newest version, the first written in English.
Hopefully this guideline will serve both students and faculty with its instructions that include both formal and informal regulations and recommendations. In the first phase, the constructive comments are received with pleasure by raija.halonen@oulu.fi.
