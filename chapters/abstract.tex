\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Abstract}
Abstract is needed to sum the master’s thesis up. The abstract is to be uploaded into Optima before the final grading of the thesis. Please find the current information about the format given in Optima.

The guide includes instructions for students. It is written keeping in mind the idea that the user may utilise it e.g. by pasting his or her text on the current text. The contents include information about formatting the text, positioning tables and figures, among other things. In addition, the use of proper literature is instructed. Even if there is no strict structure for the thesis, a recommendation is offered in this guideline.

One important guideline for the text is that do not write too short paragraphs. For instance, if there is only one sentence in a paragraph, the sentence must be really important and influential to form a paragraph of its own.

It is not possible to provide information in a guideline like this for all issues related to master’s thesis. For example, the research process, ways to acquire research material and its analysis are excluded in the guideline. On the other hand, a structure for a research plan is provided in the appendices.
